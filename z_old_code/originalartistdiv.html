                    <h5>Cibo Matto</h5>
                    <p>Cibo Matto (meaning crazy food in Italian is a New York City-based band formed by two Japanese women, Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori, in 1994. Initially, the lyrics in their songs were primarily concerned with food, before expanding into broader subject matter following the addition of Sean Lennon, Timo Ellis, and Duma Love to the band, showcased on their second studio album. While the two founding members of the group are Japanese expatriates, the group is not especially popular in Japan; the group did not gain nearly as large a following in Japan as it did in the United States. According to Billboard, their first album Viva! La Woman sold only 20,000 copies in Japan but over 74,000 copies in the U.S. Japanese listeners did not understand the appeal of the group.</p>
