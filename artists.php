                <p class="page-p">The last time Cibo Matto released an album, it was 1999's Stereo Type A. Then, they went on a long hiatus before returning for some reunion dates a couple years ago. Now, Miho Hatori and Yuka C. Honda are returning with a new LP called Hotel Valentine. It's out February 14 via Chimera Music.
                Their first offering from the album is "MFN", which features Reggie Watts. It's got a colorful, erratic video by Georgia. Check it out below.
                The album was self-produced over the course of two years and features guest spots from Nels Cline, Glenn Kotche, Mauro Refosco (of Atoms for Peace), Watts, and others. According to the press release, it's a concept album with a love story and ghosts in a hotel. 
                Honda talked about working on the album, what it's about, and reconnecting creatively with Hatori:</p>
                <p class="page-p">“'Hotel Valentine' was the first song we wrote together for this album. It thus represents the genesis of our concept or story, but in a way it seems that explaining too much would prevent listeners from coming to their own conclusions about each song as well as about the whole project. Yes, there is a ghost girl, a hotel, housekeeping ladies and things happen. But they are elusive in nature.”
                “Having spent some time apart, we became more aware of our magical chemistry, our magnetic bond. We both realized we had unfinished business.”
                Hatori added:</p>
                <p class="page-p">"Hotel Valentine is the cinematic bricolage of Yuka and me. Our medium is music. For me, making an album is like raising a child. We don't know what kind of person (story) they will end up to be.”</p>

                <p class="page-p">Ike Yard is an electronic band founded in 1979 in New York. Members are Stuart Argabright, Kenny Compton (bass/vocals), Fred Szymanski (synthesizers/ programming) and Michael Diekmann (guitar). Together they recorded for labels like Disques du Crépuscule and Factory. Ike Yard dissolved at the beginning of 1983. Although Ike Yard dissolved by the beginning of 1983, the band reformed as a three piece unit with original members Stuart Argabright, Kenneth Compton and Michael Diekmann in 2007, only a year after Acute records released a well received career anthology titled Ike Yard: 1980-82 Collected. After a hiatus of roughly 28 years, Danish/Swedish imprint Phisteria released Öst, a limited edition 10", which was followed by their latest full length Nord, Phisteria licensing the album to Desire Records for worldwide distribution.</p>
